What is pneumonia?,"Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can cause symptoms such as fever, coughing, and sometimes trouble breathing. It is a very common illness, especially in children under 5 years old."
"Is there a pneumonia ""season""?","While pneumonia can occur at any time, there is an increased likelihood of getting pneumonia after having a cold or the flu, particularly during the fall and winter months, which are also considered cold and flu seasons. These illnesses can make it harder to fight infection, thus sometimes being referred to as pneumonia season."
What are the types of pneumonia?,"The most common types of pneumonia are viral and bacterial. Viral pneumonia can be caused by various viruses, including the influenza virus (flu), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus. Bacterial pneumonia is often referred to as ""community-acquired pneumonia"" (CAP)"
How is pneumonia treated?,"Most cases of pneumonia in children can be treated at home and typically get better in 1 to 2 weeks. However, some cases, especially in babies and children with certain other medical problems, may require hospitalization."
Who is most at risk for pneumonia?,"Children under the age of 5 are at the highest risk for pneumonia. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest under-5 mortality rate due to pneumonia and other preventable diseases. Access to simple, affordable interventions like immunization and quality care by a trained health provider can prevent or treat these conditions"
