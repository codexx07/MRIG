What is pneumonia?,"Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can cause symptoms such as fever, coughing, and sometimes trouble breathing. It is a very common illness, especially in children under 5 years old."
"Is there a pneumonia ""season""?","While pneumonia can occur at any time, there is an increased likelihood of getting pneumonia after having a cold or the flu, particularly during the fall and winter months, which are also considered cold and flu seasons. These illnesses can make it harder to fight infection, thus sometimes being referred to as pneumonia season."
What are the types of pneumonia?,"The most common types of pneumonia are viral and bacterial. Viral pneumonia can be caused by various viruses, including the influenza virus (flu), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus. Bacterial pneumonia is often referred to as ""community-acquired pneumonia"" (CAP)"
